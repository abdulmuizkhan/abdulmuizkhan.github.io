<h3>breaking news</h3>
    <p>A new start-up has just launched a new generation connected watch. They have named it eSmart !
        The manufacturers of this revolutionary ‘smartwatch’ have made a real impression at the beginning of this year, with thousands of customers already convinced. The eSmart is the first high-tech new generation connected watch which is 3 TIMES less expensive than its direct competitors. The pickiest customers have all fallen for its sleek design, the ergonomics of its body and its ease of use.
        
        <strong>sales have really skyrocketed all over the world…</strong> 
        
        And we wanted <em>help</em>  you understand why and how this connected watch has become popular so quickly?!
        
        It is a known fact that the big brands earn huge amounts profits from their sales. Every year, they persuade customers to purchase supposedly new connected watches with the same functionalities as the previous versions but always at a higher price… (almost the price of an iPhone).
        
        We have asked ourselves: would we be able to manufacture a connected watch as performant as a Samsung Galaxy or other connected watches which are currently ‘dominating’ the technological market without breaking the bank ?
        
        We have conducted our own research in order to find out why everybody started choosing the eSmart over, for example, a Samsung connected watch.
        
        What is it?
        It is called eSmartand has already conquered the hearts of thousands of users who have swapped their watch (classical or connected) for this technological beauty… Not surprising, considering it’s very similar to other high-performing connected watches, except a lot cheaper!
